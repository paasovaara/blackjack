# Blackjack Java App

This is the actual game. It will open UDP server socket to listen incoming sensor data and then forwards the game state to the views (Robot & UI).

## Running

Application entry point is blackjack.Main. For simple test run you can run the app without any flags. This will get input from the console and print out the game.

See [Main-class](src/blackjack/Main.java) for more app arguments.

## AI

AI is trained using the Octave scripts in the project root folder. However this app is used to generate the training data. Relevant classes can be found in the blackjack.ai package. Generating the training data happens via arguments in the main class (see above).

Steps for updating the AI:
1) generate the training data using this app
2) train the model using Octave scripts and move the generated file to this project.
3) if model is completely new, extend class Classifier to suit your model 
4) load the model from file generated by the octave scripts.
